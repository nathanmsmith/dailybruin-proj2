## Report (Nathan)

The biggest challenge for me this week was giving up most control of this project to Colin. I don't have much team coding experience, so I tend to always want to go over all my code and have a final review before releasing or sending it off to someone else. However, my dad is visiting this weekend, and as a result, I don't have time Saturday afternoon to go over the project one last time and make sure there are no bugs. Which is really tough to do, but I trust Colin to do it.

Other than that, I tried to make Javascript (or specifically ES6) the thing of the week to learn. I added a linter ([ESLint](http://eslint.org)) with the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to my text editor, and followed all of its reccomendations. It was really illuminating to see how other people styled their code. While I didn't nessecarily agree with all of their choices (who [prefixes a dollar sign before a jQuery variable](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#jquery--dollar-prefix)?), I could see the reasoning for why all of those rules were made. I wish I had the opportunity to delve more into handlebars, but I'm leaving that up to Colin.

As for things in the next training, I'm down to learn anything. I'm not sure if this is out of the scope of training but going into some backend stuff like Node or Django would be really cool to do.
